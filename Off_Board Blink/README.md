# Off Board Blink
The off board blink utilizes the same code as the multiple button blink, however the point of this part is not to code it is to build the same system off the convenience of all the inner workings of the board. The watchdog timer still needs to be stopped, so the code doesnt reset on us without us wanting it to, but instead of enabling a resistor we need to just put one in the circuit on the bread board.
